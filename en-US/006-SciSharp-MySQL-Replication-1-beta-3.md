# SciSharp Brings Real-time MySQL Change Data Capture to .NET with SciSharp.MySQL.Replication 1.0.0-beta.3

**April 30, 2025** - The SciSharp STACK team is excited to announce the release of **SciSharp.MySQL.Replication 1.0.0-beta.3**, a powerful C# implementation of the MySQL replication protocol client. This library enables .NET developers to tap into MySQL's binary log stream, receiving real-time database events including inserts, updates, deletes, and raw SQL queries directly from MySQL servers.

## A Game-Changer for .NET Database Monitoring

SciSharp.MySQL.Replication allows developers to build sophisticated database monitoring, data synchronization, auditing, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solutions by leveraging MySQL's native replication capabilities. By acting as a replica client, applications can receive a continuous stream of database changes without adding any overhead to the original database operations.

"With this library, we're bringing the power of MySQL's binary log protocol to the .NET ecosystem in a developer-friendly way," said Kerry Jiang, lead contributor to the project. "This enables a whole new category of applications that can react to database changes in real-time."

## Key Features

- **Real-time Event Streaming**: Connect to MySQL server as a replica and process binary log events as they occur
- **Comprehensive Data Type Support**: Handle all MySQL data types including JSON, BLOB, TEXT, and more
- **Rich Event Handling**: Process various events including:
  - Query events (raw SQL statements)
  - Row events (insert, update, delete with before/after data)
  - Table maps, format description events, and transaction identifiers
- **Developer-Friendly API**: Built with async/await first design principles
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any platform supporting .NET 6.0 or higher
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient binary parsing with minimal overhead

## What's New in Beta 3

The latest 1.0.0-beta.3 release includes:

- Added support for .NET 9.0
- Improved handling of binary log events
- Enhanced parsing of JSON type data
- Fixed issues with timestamp conversion
- Performance improvements for large data sets
- Better error handling and reporting
- Updated dependencies to latest stable versions
